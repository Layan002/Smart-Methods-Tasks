# Tips for you
This is an excel sheet that contains all the tasks that I've implemented during my summer training of 2024. Hope that it will benefit you. 
And remember: **"You are an engineer, you make the impossible possible, and the possible even better"**.<br>

**Always be confident and don't loose your faith about yourself. You can do it ðŸ’ª** <br>

**Remember: If you found it hard; BREAK IT DOWN !**
